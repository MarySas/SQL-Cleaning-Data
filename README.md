# SQL-Cleaning-Data
Cleaning Data in SQL 

Cleaning data is the beginning of every good analysis.
In this project, I did the Data Cleaning from an excel file while using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Procedures during the cleaning process:
- Converting Date types;
- Checking null values;
- Fulfilling null values in addresses with the corresponding address, by using JOINS;
- Splitting Columns by using STRING, CHARINDEX;
- Splitting Columns by using UPDATE, SET, PARSENAME, REPLACE;
- Changing values to Yes and No answers by using SELECT DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE, WHEN and UPDATE;
- Removing duplicates with CTE and row_num > 1;
- Dropping columns with DROP COLUMN.
